## Explore US Bikeshare Data - Python
This project involves using Python as a tool to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the US: New York City, Chicago and Washington. The core of it is the use of descriptive statistics and data import.

The statistics computed include :

* Frequent time of travel
    - Most popular month;
    - Most popular day of the week;
    - Most common hour of the day

* Popular stations and trip
    - Most popular start station;
    - Most popular end station;
    - Most popular trip (i.e. most frequent combination of start station and end station)

* Trip duration
    - Total travel time;
    - Average travel time

* User information
    - Number of users by type;
    - Number of users by gender;
    - The oldest user;
    - The youngest user;
    - Most common year of birth
